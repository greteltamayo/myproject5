    <h1 class="h1">About Me Wedsite!</h1>

    <p>My journey to become a wed developer has had a lot of emotions because at first I thought it was all very difficult and now I realize how many things one can do if they put their minds to it. I am very proud of myself because I have managed to overcome many obstacles that I had in my life. It makes me very happy to see what I can build with just a few weeks of classes. I wish that all the people in the world would be brave and fight for their dreams. My biggest dream right now is to become a wonderful web developer and be able to spend every day doing what I'm passionate about.</p>

              <p>Founded as a Spanish mission and colonial outpost in 1718, the city in 1731 became the first chartered civil settlement in what is now present-day Texas. The area was then part of the Spanish Empire. From 1821 to 1836, it was part of the Mexican Republic. It is the oldest municipality in Texas, having celebrated its 300th anniversary on May 1, 2018.</p>

              <p>Named after King Louis XVI of France, Louisville was founded in 1778 by George Rogers Clark, making it one of the oldest cities west of the Appalachians.[10] With nearby Falls of the Ohio as the only major obstruction to river traffic between the upper Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico, the settlement first grew as a portage site. It was the founding city of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, which grew into a 6,000-mile (9,700 km) system across 13 states.</p>
