   <h1 class="h1">&#128561 MY WORST FEAR</h1>
   <p>Hi,&#128525 I'm 23 years old and recently I was interested in web development since these days in an important branch of technology. My biggest fear was failing halfway because I liked technology but I wasn't very familiar with it. I was born on a Caribbean Island called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba"> Cuba </a> where technology is not very advanced. I was very afraid of failure because I did not have a perfect command of the English language since it is my second language. Also the comments of many people who say that you can't with that, but you have to follow your signs and goals regardless of people's comments.</p>
